This file is to let you know how to run the testcase(c_zhtclient_threaded_test.c) for ZHT API with multi-thread support.

1. make

2. too see usage, run ./c_zhtclient_threaded_test or ./c_zhtclient_threaded_test -h

Usage:
./c_zhtclient_threaded_test {-t concurrent_threads -n neighbor -z zht.cfg -p {TCP|UDP} {-i(insert) | -r(remove) | -l(lookup) | -a(append) | -c(commpare_and_swap) } | [-h(help)]

for example in real tests:
a) to run insert/remove/lookup/append/comp_swap concurrently, each run by 10 threads
./c_zhtclient_threaded_test -t 10 -n neighbor -z zht.cfg -p TCP -i -r -l -a -c

b) to run insert/remove/lookup/append concurrently, each run by 10 threads
./c_zhtclient_threaded_test -t 10 -n neighbor -z zht.cfg -p TCP -i -r -l -a

c) to run insert/remove/lookup concurrently, each run by 10 threads
./c_zhtclient_threaded_test -t 10 -n neighbor -z zht.cfg -p TCP -i -r -l

d) to run insert/remove concurrently, each run by 10 threads
./c_zhtclient_threaded_test -t 10 -n neighbor -z zht.cfg -p TCP -i -r

e) to run insert concurrently, each run by 10 threads
./c_zhtclient_threaded_test -t 10 -n neighbor -z zht.cfg -p TCP -i

3. at least one of -i -r -l -a -c MUST be given.
