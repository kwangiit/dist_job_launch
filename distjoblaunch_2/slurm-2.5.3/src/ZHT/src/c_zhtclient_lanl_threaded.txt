The following is sequence you need to run this test case(c_zhtclient_lanl_threaded.c). 
You can also only run step 3 to see what will happened.

1. make
 
2. to insert 1000 nodes, run 
./c_zhtclient_lanl_threaded -n neighbor -z zht.cfg -p TCP -i

3. to concurrently allocate nodes by comp_and_swap, run
./c_zhtclient_lanl_threaded -n neighbor -z zht.cfg -p TCP

/*
=> I changed the startup arguments only for this test programs, e.g. ./c_zhtclient_lanl_threaded -n neighbor -z zht.cfg -p TCP
   to see the usage, run 
   ./c_zhtclient_lanl_threaded or 
   ./c_zhtclient_lanl_threaded -h 
*/


4. to to check nodes finally available, run 

./c_zhtclient_lanl_threaded -n neighbor -z zht.cfg -p TCP -l


###########special attention###########
1. Since the ZHT Client API is not thread-safe, this testcase is a expediency to make sure your use case(if based on the code here) works ,at least. 

2. I used the criticial section to make sure your application is thread-safe, although ZHT Client API is not.

3. copy the code and adjust it on your demand, but take care the critical section code.
